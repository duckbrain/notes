# Notes

This is a simple launcher that opens an editor for editing notes (currently markdown only). It handles opening multiple notebooks by date or week with a template for each new entry. I made this to make it easier to quickly take notes in my classes in markdown with a header in place.

My project [atom-journal](https://github.com/duckbrain/atom-journal) is roughly the same thing, but that one is an atom plugin, and this one is more convenient for editing with other editors like vim and typora.

As the project matures into something more stable, I may add some documentation on how to use it. For now, just look at the source code. It's fairly simple.
